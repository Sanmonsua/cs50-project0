    <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      You have to know how to use a French press if you want to get that delicious coffee that everyone talks about. You will be amazed by the richness of flavors, and the fantastic aroma you will get from a press pot. To get those aromas though, you
      need to master the brewing technique. This is what we intend to do on this page: to teach you how to make coffee with a French press.
      <br>
      The French press or French pot is the original European home coffee brewer. It is known as a coffee plunger in Australia and New Zealand and a cafetiere in the British Isles. These days, it lost a bit of its popularity, compared to other coffee
      making appliances. Espresso and drip coffee machines are very popular now. More recently, pour-over brewing kits, such as the V60 and the Chemex have replaced the French press in many kitchens. It is an excellent device, and we have forgotten
      how great a cup brew with this unassuming device can be.

    <h2>Grinding</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      The most common step that is overlooked by coffee lovers is grinding the beans. It is only in recent years that home baristas have started to grind fresh just before brewing. Grinding fresh is an essential step when brewing at home with any
      method. Take the time to grind your beans every morning, even if you have to set the alarm ten minutes earlier. You can buy a decent domestic grinder for around $100. It will be well worth the money!
      <br>
      Coffee beans start to lose their aroma and flavors the minute they are ground. Again, grind just before you brew, and to grind only what you use. Using freshly ground coffee is as important as drinking freshly brewed coffee.
