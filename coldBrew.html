    <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      Cold brew is a coffee brewing method, in which the brewing takes place at low temperatures ranging from room temperature or colder. The method involves steeping coffee grounds in cold water, in order to preserve volatile compounds and avoid
      extraction of substances that soluble at high temperatures. Commonly, cold brewing is done for extended periods of time, to compensate for the low temperatures.
