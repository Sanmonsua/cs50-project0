    <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      This brewing method is one of the oldest and it is better known as turkish coffee.
      Traditionally, boiled coffee is prepared in a cezve, (called ibrik in North America and many European countries). The history is not very clear if the Turks invented this brewing method or not, but they certainly made it very popular.
      <br>
      Greeks prepare it the same way, and they call it Greek coffee, the whole Middle East brews coffee the same way and it’s called Arabic coffee, or Lebanese coffee.
      <br>
      You can call it however you want, the coffee gets prepared the same way, with small variations, such as adding various spices. More about this next…

    <h2>Grinding</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      The uniqueness of Turkish coffee is given by the exceptionally very fine grind size. The ground coffee is milled into a powder. This ensures a very fast extraction time, the fastest extraction possible. It also facilitates a better dissolution
      of the soluble solids, which give Turkish coffee its distinctive body.
      <br>
      The domestic electric burr grinders are not capable of grinding Turkish size, because their motor is not strong enough for the huge force needed. Grinders that are advertised as such will give you a fine grind, but not the real thing. Real
      Turkish coffee grind can be obtained with either commercial machines or manual grinding machines. You have to do some manual grinding, but it is worth the effort. Read this article for more tips on grinding Turkish coffee.
      <br>
      Some Arabic coffee recipes call for coarsely ground coffee. Greek coffee uses in its recipe the finest grind, while Turkish uses just a slightly coarser grind.

    <h2>Taste</h2>
    <p>
      If you wonder what to expect from a cup of Turkish, or Greek coffee, (exactly the same recipe), let me tell you, it doesn’t look, or taste like any other coffee you drank. The beverage is very dark, and you can see it’s a strong coffee. There
      is no considerably more caffeine in a cup brewed this way, but there are more soluble solids and more coffee oils than in any other brewing method.
      <br>
      Turkish coffee in traditional cups
      The classic recipe calls for sugar, and this is the way most of the people will drink it. However, I have friends who drink it black. I like mine a little sweet.
      <br>
      The taste of a classic Turkish coffee is a little on the bitter side, but if you tweak your brewing parameters, you can avoid that. Some people like to compare it with espresso, and it has some of the espresso attributes, but the brightness of
      espresso is missing with this brewing type.
      <br>
      The lack of pressure during extraction provide you with a more dulled profile, but very tasty, nonetheless. The taste and the aroma are closer to a French press brew if you want, but more flavorful. The extra flavor and aroma are enhanced
      because of the very fine grind. The fine grind allows more sugars, oils and other solids to pass into the coffee. The beverage is very thick, and it is a strong coffee. Turkish coffee has the highest TDS among all coffee brewing methods. The
      foam on top and the deep black color fo the coffee make it easy to recognise.
      <br>
      A Greek, or Arabic, or Turkish coffee will fill up with aroma large spaces. In fact, my wife brews a cup in the weekend mornings knowing that the smell coming from the kitchen downstairs will wake me up. It is the best way to be awakened. The
      smell only gets me a little caffeinated, if you can believe that.
      <br>
      Arabic coffee is a twist on Turkish coffee. The change is the addition of various finely ground spices to obtain a nice aroma. Traditionally, there are no spices in a Turkish or a Greek, or an Eastern European coffee. The spices used with
      Arabic coffee are cardamom or saffron most usually. Other spices used are cloves or rose water. The ratio is three parts ground coffee to one part cardamom, but you can tweak this to your taste.
      <br>
      Properly prepared, a Turkish coffee is a strong beverage, with a full body. It is a dense beverage, saturated with soluble solids. It is stronger than most other brewing techniques but does not contain more caffeine. The popular belief is that
      a Turkish coffee will make you jittery, as too much espresso does. In reality, Turkish coffee does not give you jitters unless of course, you drink three cups at once. However, if you boil Turkish coffee, as with some recipes, it will have more
      caffeine. The longer you boil it the more caffeine will dissolve into your cup. However, boiled coffee tastes bad.
