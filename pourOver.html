    <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      Pour over coffee is probably one of the trendiest manual coffee brewing methods. It is more and more popular, even in places where convenience supersedes taste. The tutorial on “how to make pour-over coffee” was my projects for a while, and as
      a manual brewing enthusiast, I should have written this earlier.
      <br>
      Anyway, today I shook off the lethargy and I am going to show you how to brew the perfect hand drip coffee. This is mainly because of a recent coffee date that I went on. I ordered my standard cup of pour-over-filter-coffee while my friend had
      a latte. After a few minutes of chatting, she noticed that the coffee was taking longer than normal. I told her that the pour over brewing method takes a little more time to prepare than espresso coffee. She looked over to the bar where the
      barista was bent over the pour over coffee equipment and said: “But it looks so easy!”
      <br>
      Yes, as a matter of fact, it is easy to brew with a manual coffee dripper. But if you make a little mistake your coffee will be ruined. You have to be precise, and respect the recipe and the technique. I spent the rest of the date talking about
      the specifics of pour over coffee brewing and wondering if other people thought that pour over brewing was easy.

    <h2>Best Coffee Cones</h2>
    <p class="font-weight-normal">
      In manual drip brewing, the coffee and filter are in the open air and the water is added by the barista, not by a machine. Pour over coffee makers can be glass, plastic, ceramic or metal. Glass and plastic pour over coffee makers are popular
      because it’s possible to see the whole process as it happens.

    <h2>Best Coffee Beans</h2>
    <p>
      The best pour over coffees are lighter, brighter and fruitier coffees. Darker, more full-bodied coffees are not generally considered good coffees to use with pour-over brewers. This is because the brewing time isn’t as long with pour over coffees compared to the French press and so lots of the fuller flavors and oils are not extracted from the bean. I recommend a light to medium roast coffee with light, bright and floral notes. Coffees from Ethiopia and Rwanda are always a good choice here. But Brazilian beans are a great option for a delicate palate.
